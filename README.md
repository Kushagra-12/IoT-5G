### 5G Architecture
5G is effectively a dynamic, coherent and flexible framework of multiple advanced technologies supporting a variety of applications. 5G utilizes a more intelligent architecture, with Radio Access Networks (RANs) no longer constrained by base station proximity or complex infrastructure. 5G leads the way towards disaggregated, flexible and virtual RAN with new interfaces creating additional data access points.

### 3GPP

3GPP, or the 3rd Generation Partnership Project, was initially formed in December 1998 when the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) partnered with other standard development organizations (SDOs) from around the world to develop new technologies

What is 3GPP 5G NR?
5G NR (New Radio) is a new radio access technology (RAT) developed by 3GPP for the 5G (fifth generation) mobile network. It was designed to be the global standard for the air interface of 5G networks.

### 5G Architecture 3GPP 
- The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) covers telecommunication technologies including RAN, core transport networks and service capabilities. 3GPP has provided complete system specifications for 5G network architecture which is much more service oriented than previous generations
- Services are provided via a common framework to network functions that are permitted to make use of these services. Modularity, reusability and self-containment of network functions are additional design considerations for a 5G network architecture described by the 3GPP specifications.

### 5G Spectrum and Frequency
- Multiple frequency ranges are now being dedicated to 5G new radio (NR). The portion of the radio spectrum with frequencies between 30 GHz and 300 GHz is known as the millimeter wave, since wavelengths range from 1-10 mm. Frequencies between 24 GHz and 100 GHz are now being allocated to 5G in multiple regions worldwide. 
- In addition to the millimeter wave, underutilized UHF frequencies between 300 MHz and 3 GHz are also being repurposed for 5G. The diversity of frequencies employed can be tailored to the unique applications considering the higher frequencies are characterized by higher bandwidth, albeit shorter range. The millimeter wave frequencies are ideal for densely populated areas, but ineffective for long distance communication. 

### 5G NR / 4G LTE

- NR has a radio structure that makes it compatible with LTE but better prepared for future technology solutions and use cases such as higher spectral efficiency, traffic capacity and shorter user plane latency.
- An important goal of 5G NR is to support the growth of wireless communication by enhancing electromagnetic radiation spectrum efficiency for mobile broadband.
- networks can move vast amounts of data more efficiently than with 4G LTE.

### MEC
- Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) is an important element of 5G architecture. MEC is an evolution in cloud computing that brings the applications from centralized data centers to the network edge, and therefore closer to the end users and their devices. 
- This technology is not exclusive to 5G but is certainly integral to its efficiency. Characteristics of the MEC include the low latency, high bandwidth and real time access to RAN information that distinguish 5G architecture from its predecessors.
- The 5G specifications define the enablers for edge computing, allowing MEC and 5G to collaboratively route traffic. In addition to the latency and bandwidth benefits of the MEC architecture, the distribution of computing power will better enable the high volume of connected devices inherent to 5G deployment and the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT). 

### NFV and 5G
- Network function virtualization (NFV) decouples software from hardware by replacing various network functions such as firewalls, load balancers and routers with virtualized instances running as software. This eliminates the need to invest in many expensive hardware elements and can also accelerate installation times, thereby providing revenue generating services to the customer faster. 
- NFV enables the 5G infrastructure by virtualizing appliances within the 5G network. This includes the network slicing technology that enables multiple virtual networks to run simultaneously.
